This app provides information about talks that have been given
at Social Media Cafe events in Liverpool.

The app was created as a basic example of using the
HierarchyApp & HierarchyViewController source code available
here: https://github.com/johnmckerrell/HierarchyApp

To build smcliv you will need to run the following commands from
within your checked out smcliv repository to retrieve the
HierarchyApp source code:

git submodule init
git submodule update

To use the WebBrowserViewController you will also need some
images from the iOS SDK. I recommend you use UIKit Artwork Extractor:

https://github.com/0xced/UIKit-Artwork-Extractor

You will need the following files:

UIButtonBarArrowLeft.png
UIButtonBarArrowLeft@2x.png
UIButtonBarArrowRight.png
UIButtonBarArrowRight@2x.png
UIButtonBarRefresh.png
UIButtonBarRefresh@2x.png
UIButtonBarStop.png
UIButtonBarStop@2x.png


Other icons included in HierarchyApp are taken from the Glyphish icon set
and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license. Please
be aware of this if you intend to re-use them in your own app,

Icons available on the app store may include icons from the
Glyphish Pro set, these will not be included in the resource
